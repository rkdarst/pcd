"""Temporal network structures in sqlite3.

This module contains a structure suitable for holding temporal
networks.  All data is loaded into an sqlite3 database, which can be
either in-memory or on-disk.  Then, events can be efficiently queried
in a variety of ways.

The basic structure contains four fields: a, b, t, dt.  These
correspond to first event, second event, time, and time duration.  The
'dt' field is not implemented yet.  Generally, `a` and `b` are assumed
to be ints, and `t` is assumed to be a float.  However, this is not a
restriction of sqlite, and most code here is general enough to handle
any input formats, but this is not tested or an explicit goal (yet).

The network can also be queried from the command line using the
`sqlite3` command line tool, if saved to a file.  This allows useful
investigation and analytics without having to use Python.

For example usage, see test_tnetsql.py
